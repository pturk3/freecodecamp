                <p>Linux is a free and open-source kernel that serves as the core to an alternative operating system for
                    PCs, Laptops and Servers. Over the years, hundreds and hundreds more Linux “distributions” have
                    surfaced to take their place as people's OS of choice. Of these, some of the principal players in
                    this space are Debian, Arch and Red Hat. For beginners though, or people who are after a well-oiled
                    machine with minimal tinkering, one of the most common recommendations is Ubuntu. </p>

                <p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian, maintained by a company called Canonical. It was
                    founded in 2004 and was instantly loved for its polished look, ease of use and the unity desktop
                    environment that it was sporting. Since 2017, Ubuntu has moved away from unity and has made GNOME
                    its default desktop environment (DE) for its primary release. Whilst GNOME is a beautiful and fluid
                    option for some, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, whether it be for aesthetic reasons, or because the
                    hardware they’re using doesn’t play well with GNOME to the fact that it can be resource heavy.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this, and because the Linux world is nothing if not creative and forward thinking, developers
                    started spinning up their own versions of Ubuntu, called “flavours”, that utilise different desktop
                    environments. Some of these flavours, have come to be Official Ubuntu flavours, conforming to
                    Canonical’s policies and structures, where applicable. Some of these flavours are:
                    Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu MATE, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu among many others.

                    <p>This flavor of the Ubuntu is geared more towards capturing the interest of those users who are on the fence about leaving Windows as their primary OS. Lubuntu provides a very Windows-like experience while sticking to the roots of Linux-based OS.</p>

                    <p>Its environment is extremely simplistic and uses a lightweight LXDE Desktop Environment. Additionally, this flavor also does not require a high-end device like the Ubuntu GNOM and will run perfectly on most of the devices; it only requires 1GB of RAM for functioning properly.</p>

                <p>However, the Ubuntu world is not just made up of official flavours. There are also other
                    distributions who only take advantage of Ubuntu’s stable base and keep it at it’s core, while
                    proposing a different experience to that of it’s parent. Some of the more prominent examples are:
                    PopOS, Linux Mint, elementary OS, KDE Neon amongst so many more.</p>
