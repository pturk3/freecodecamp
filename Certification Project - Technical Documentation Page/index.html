                <p>Linux is a free and open-source kernel that serves as the core to an alternative operating system for
                    PCs, Laptops and Servers. Over the years, hundreds and hundreds more Linux “distributions” have
                    surfaced to take their place as people's OS of choice. Of these, some of the principal players in
                    this space are Debian, Arch and Red Hat. For beginners though, or people who are after a well-oiled
                    machine with minimal tinkering, one of the most common recommendations is Ubuntu. </p>

            <header>What is Ubuntu?</header>

            <article>
                <p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian, maintained by a company called Canonical. It was
                    founded in 2004 and was instantly loved for its polished look, ease of use and the unity desktop
                    environment that it was sporting. Since 2017, Ubuntu has moved away from unity and has made GNOME
                    its default desktop environment (DE) for its primary release. Whilst GNOME is a beautiful and fluid
                    option for some, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, whether it be for aesthetic reasons, or because the
                    hardware they’re using doesn’t play well with GNOME to the fact that it can be resource heavy.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this, and because the Linux world is nothing if not creative and forward thinking, developers
                    started spinning up their own versions of Ubuntu, called “flavours”, that utilise different desktop
                    environments. Some of these flavours, have come to be Official Ubuntu flavours, conforming to
                    Canonical’s policies and structures, where applicable. Some of these flavours are:
                    Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu MATE, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu among many others.

                <cite>Sources: linuxhint (https://linuxhint.com/best_ubuntu_flavors/) and Fossmint
                    (https://www.fossmint.com/which-ubuntu-flavor-should-you-choose/)</cite>

                <div id="ubuntu_budgie">
                    <header>Ubuntu Budgie</header>
                    <p>This flavor is rather new in the market. The Ubuntu Budgie has a beautiful and a modern take on
                        Linux that will please everyone’s aesthetics. The learning curve of Budgie is fairly easy when
                        compared with other flavors of Ubuntu; this calls for a special mention for the developers and
                        designers who ensured a familiar look while improving things all around.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this flavor was to create an elegant and simple desktop interface. The Budgie also
                        has a customizable factor which plays in its favor and it </p>

                    <p>Another neat feature that has been introduced in Budgie is the sidebar where applications can be
                        quickly revealed and hidden. The sidebar holds applets and notifications and it can help you
                        keep your desktop clutter-free.</p>

                    <header>Ubuntu MATE</header>
                    <p>Ubuntu Mate is an Ubuntu variant that beautifully integrates the MATE DE. The MATE Desktop
                        Environment is based on GNOME 2, and not GNOME 3, which Ubuntu GNOME uses.It is available for
                        different architecture types so if you are attracted to a traditional desktop UI then Ubuntu
                        MATE is for you.</p>

                    <p>It is particularly good for older hardware, and comes with an inbuilt layout chooser, for those
                        who want to tweak the GNOME 2 look to resemble MacOS or Windows</p>

                <div id="lubuntu">
                    <header>Lubuntu</header>
                    <p>This flavor of the Ubuntu is geared more towards capturing the interest of those users who are on
                        the fence about leaving Windows as their primary OS. Lubuntu provides a very Windows-like
                        experience while sticking to the roots of Linux-based OS.</p>

                    <p>Its environment is extremely simplistic and uses a lightweight LXDE Desktop Environment.
                        Additionally, this flavor also does not require a high-end device like the Ubuntu GNOM and will
                        run perfectly on most of the devices; it only requires 1GB of RAM for functioning properly.</p>

                <div id="kubuntu">
                    <header>Kubuntu</header>
                    <p>Are you someone who’s more into the aesthetics of the OS? Well, then, Kubuntu is what you are
                        looking for. Commonly referred to as the KDE Ubuntu, this flavor has easily one of sleekest
                        user-interface thanks to its integration with Plasma DE.</p>

                    <p>It is extremely customizable and very efficient for general purpose computing, requiring only 2GB
                        of RAM to operate to its fullest potential.</p>

                    <p>Kubuntu has kept the essence of the Windows OS while remaining true to its roots; it has a start
                        menu, taskbar, system tray etc. This helps all the users who are aiming to switch from Windows
                        OS to Linux but are always hesitant. The modern version of Kubuntu provides an equally reliable
                        and user-friendly environment which is an added bonus for the users.</p>

                    <p>Xubuntu is a memory-friendly Ubuntu flavour that requires at least 1GB RAM. It works efficiently
                        for various computing workflow and uses the Xfce DE.</p>

                    <p>It may not be the polished look that one wants out of the box, but XFCE is highly customizable
                        and can be refined to your standards</p>

                <p>However, the Ubuntu world is not just made up of official flavours. There are also other
                    distributions who only take advantage of Ubuntu’s stable base and keep it at it’s core, while
                    proposing a different experience to that of it’s parent. Some of the more prominent examples are:
                    PopOS, Linux Mint, and elementary OS amongst so many more.</p>

                <div id="popos">
                    <header>PopOS</header>
                    <p>Ideal For: Gamers and Programmers</p>
                    <p>Developed and managed by computer hardware vendor System76. Pop!_OS is the default operating
                        system on System76 laptops and computers. It is also available to download and install for free
                        on other computers and laptops.</p>
                    <p>It is feature-rich and one of the most modern-looking operating systems. Again, Pop!_OS is also
                        based on Ubuntu LTS, but it offers its own unique user interface, which is easy to use.</p>
                    <p>This Linux distro is ideal for gamers as it is ships-in with the necessary tools for gaming.
                        Hybrid graphics cards work flawlessly with this distro, which helps you take your gaming
                        experience to the next level.</p>
                    <p>Pop!_OS ships in with minimum apps, which saves in space where you can install your favorite apps
                        easily. Like Software Center on Ubuntu, here you have Pop!_Shop from where you can download and
                        install apps.</p>

                    <p>Ideal For: Beginners and Those Switching from Windows</p>

                    <p>Linux Mint is gaining so much popularity alongside Ubuntu; it is becoming more popular among
                        novice users because it is more user-friendly and lightweight than Ubuntu. As I told you
                        earlier, LinuxMint is developed based on Linux; hence you can feel the essence of Ubuntu in
                        LinuxMint.</p>

                    <p>It is an ideal replacement for Windows because Cinnamon desktop offers a similar or even more
                        superior desktop experience with a low footprint. Yes, it requires low hardware resources,
                        making it an ideal operating system for old computers and laptops.</p>

                    <p>Like Ubuntu, LinuxMint also has a large online community watching its back. All the applications
                        available for Ubuntu also work on LinuxMint effortlessly.</p>

                    <p>Elementary OS is another beautiful-looking Linux distribution. Its user interface is clean and
                        modern, which resembles the user interface of macOS.</p>

                    <p>The latest edition of elementary OS is OS 6 Odin which came with a major user interface and
                        feature revamp. Key updates include multi-touch, dark style, app sandboxing, and a new
                        installer. This is a great Linux distro for a creator like me with features like multitasking
                        view, picture-in-picture, and do not disturb mode.</p>

            <header>How To Try Them Out</header>

            <article>
                <p>The best way to see if any of these Ubuntu based distro's are for you, is to try them out! It's quite
                    easy, and below are the easy steps to show you how! Just be warned: Linux can get your enthusiasm up
                    very quickly, so don't get caught in a never ending, distro hopping loop. Once you found one that
                    you like, and suits your use cases, then get yourself set up, and immerse yourself!</p>

                <h3>How-to steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure you back up all your data, just incase</li>
                    <li>Get a USB drive you have lying around - make sure it's at least 8GB for best results</li>
                    <li>Download and install Balena Etcher from <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher">here</a></li>
                    <li>Go to the official site of the distro you want to try, and download the ISO that is most
                        relevent to you</li>
                    <li>Once downloaded, open Balena Etcher and Flash the ISO to the thumb drive</li>
                    <li>Once its complete, switch off your PC/Laptop, insert the thumb drive, and get the PC to boot off
                        USB</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                    <li>If you installed linux completely, i recommend you update the system just after install. You can
                        do this via the GUI onboard, or via terminal. For all the Ubuntu and Debian based distro's you
                        should be able to apply the following:</li>
                    <code>sudo apt update</code>
                    <p>and after that</p>
                    <code>sudo apt upgrade</code>
                </ol>
