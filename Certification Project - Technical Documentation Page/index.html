                <p>Linux is a free and open-source kernel that serves as the core to an alternative operating system for
                    PCs, Laptops and Servers. Over the years, hundreds and hundreds more Linux “distributions” have
                    surfaced to take their place as people's OS of choice. Of these, some of the principal players in
                    this space are Debian, Arch and Red Hat. For beginners though, or people who are after a well-oiled
                    machine with minimal tinkering, one of the most common recommendations is Ubuntu. </p>

            <article>
                <p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian, maintained by a company called Canonical. It was
                    founded in 2004 and was instantly loved for its polished look, ease of use and the unity desktop
                    environment that it was sporting. Since 2017, Ubuntu has moved away from unity and has made GNOME
                    its default desktop environment (DE) for its primary release. Whilst GNOME is a beautiful and fluid
                    option for some, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, whether it be for aesthetic reasons, or because the
                    hardware they’re using doesn’t play well with GNOME to the fact that it can be resource heavy.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this, and because the Linux world is nothing if not creative and forward thinking, developers
                    started spinning up their own versions of Ubuntu, called “flavours”, that utilise different desktop
                    environments. Some of these flavours, have come to be Official Ubuntu flavours, conforming to
                    Canonical’s policies and structures, where applicable. Some of these flavours are:
                    Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu MATE, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu among many others.

                    <header>Ubuntu Budgie</header>
                    <p>This flavor is rather new in the market. The Ubuntu Budgie has a beautiful and a modern take on Linux that will please everyone’s aesthetics. The learning curve of Budgie is fairly easy when compared with other flavors of Ubuntu; this calls for a special mention for the developers and designers who ensured a familiar look while improving things all around.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this flavor was to create an elegant and simple desktop interface. The Budgie also has a customizable factor which plays in its favor and it </p>

                    <p>Another neat feature that has been introduced in Budgie is the sidebar where applications can be quickly revealed and hidden. The sidebar holds applets and notifications and it can help you keep your desktop clutter-free.</p>

                <div id="ubuntu_mate">
                    <header>Ubuntu MATE</header>
                     <p>Ubuntu Mate is an Ubuntu variant that beautifully integrates the MATE DE. The MATE Desktop Environment is based on GNOME 2, and not GNOME 3, which Ubuntu GNOME uses.It is available for different architecture types so if you are attracted to a traditional desktop UI then Ubuntu MATE is for you.</p>

                     <p>It is particularly good for older hardware, and comes with an inbuilt layout chooser, for those who want to tweak the GNOME 2 look to resemble MacOS or Windows</p>

                    <header>Lubuntu</header>
                    <p>This flavor of the Ubuntu is geared more towards capturing the interest of those users who are on the fence about leaving Windows as their primary OS. Lubuntu provides a very Windows-like experience while sticking to the roots of Linux-based OS.</p>

                    <p>Its environment is extremely simplistic and uses a lightweight LXDE Desktop Environment. Additionally, this flavor also does not require a high-end device like the Ubuntu GNOM and will run perfectly on most of the devices; it only requires 1GB of RAM for functioning properly.</p>

                    <header>Kubuntu</header>
                    <p>Are you someone who’s more into the aesthetics of the OS? Well, then, Kubuntu is what you are looking for. Commonly referred to as the KDE Ubuntu, this flavor has easily one of sleekest user-interface thanks to its integration with Plasma DE.</p>

                    <p>It is extremely customizable and very efficient for general purpose computing, requiring only 2GB of RAM to operate to its fullest potential.</p>

                    <p>Kubuntu has kept the essence of the Windows OS while remaining true to its roots; it has a start menu, taskbar, system tray etc. This helps all the users who are aiming to switch from Windows OS to Linux but are always hesitant. The modern version of Kubuntu provides an equally reliable and user-friendly environment which is an added bonus for the users.</p>

                    <p>Xubuntu is a memory-friendly Ubuntu flavour that requires at least 1GB RAM. It works efficiently for various computing workflow and uses the Xfce DE.</p>

                    <p>It may not be the polished look that one wants out of the box, but XFCE is highly customizable and can be refined to your standards</p>

                <p>However, the Ubuntu world is not just made up of official flavours. There are also other
                    distributions who only take advantage of Ubuntu’s stable base and keep it at it’s core, while
                    proposing a different experience to that of it’s parent. Some of the more prominent examples are:
                    PopOS, Linux Mint, elementary OS, KDE Neon amongst so many more.</p>
